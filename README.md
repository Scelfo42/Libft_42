<h1>Libft</h1>

This project was my very first project as a student at 42Firenze. I needed to recode a few functions of the C standard library as well as some other utility functions that resulted useful during my whole cursus.

<h2>Project overview</h2>

The mandatory section of Libft involves crafting custom functions mirroring standard libc functions, serving as vital tools for 42cursus projects. It provides hands-on experience in custom library development. Upon completion, you can explore the bonus segment, which specifically delves into list and structure: differentiation, manipulation, usage.
